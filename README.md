# Tanya's Diploma
The program may be called a 'Kaspersky Antivirus setting simulator'. It was made sort of by order, to help my friend Tanya.

The problem is that considered version of the Antivirus is absent in free access. Nevertheless, specialists in Academy must know how to work with it. Using the program, students may know how to operate this version without actually getting to where it's installed.

The principle of operation is based on switching of screenshots at the background after clicking on the invisible buttons above the buttons on the screenshots.

NOTE. Resource files are needed to run the program: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-H66g1jdHlF8ITQmdq_6x7c4ODXCwvXn
